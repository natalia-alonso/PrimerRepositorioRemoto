+ ###  The Late Late Show
     #### With usual host, James Corden, filming a movie abroad, Harry steped up as a guest-host for the late late show. He wore what, in my opnion, is one his tamest but still super stilish outfits, a brown stripped suit pared with a blue stripped shirt.

+ ###  Adore You
     #### For this music video Harry went so far out his way to create a whole fictional island. This video has a beautiful story line, with Harry being the only person in the island capable of smilling. He feels out of place and uncapable of fitting in when he meets his best friend, a literal fish, that helps him find happiness and a sense of purpose. Get a box of tissues and prepare to cry to this emotive music video by clicking the link down bellow.
